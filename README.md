# Canvas gaming

A project to build a simple game using the canvas html 5 api. Doesn't work on mobile due both to lack of hardware keyboard and because it isn't optimized for lower power devices.

A focus is placed on dynamic rendering using the canvas to better optimize for small size. This means there is a lot of non-gpu rendering which will likely cause issues on mobile and other slower processors. longer term solutions can be explored, but this is primarily a proof of concept, not currently a marketed product.

## Run locally:

- `npm install` -- Installs dependencies
- `npm start` -- runs application locally watching for changes.
